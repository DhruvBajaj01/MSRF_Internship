For facilitating the autocomplete feature using NLP, the process is broken down into two steps-
1. Text Preprocessing
2. Algorithm development

For preprocessing, methods such as removal of white spaces, numbers and stopwords etc are performed.

Used python libraries for implementation of algorithms for autocompletion of text and autocorrect.
