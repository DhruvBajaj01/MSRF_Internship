Speeded Up Robust Features(SURF)

The Speeded Up Robust Features method a.k.a the SURF method is a remarkable research paper authored by Herbert Bay, Andreas Ess, Tinne Tuytelaars and Luc Van Gool. It has been developed into an algorithm that is being used in many computer vision applications like object detection, object classification, 3-D construction, object tracking etc. This is a lightning-fast and robust algorithm, also used for real-time object detection
